If it's zero, or as a rule of thumb, 0.2 or less, there is little additive genetic variation for that trait, and any modeling of the association between the trait and molecular variation is likely to be unsuccessful.\n\nHere I calculate h^2^ for biomass data in the switchgrass diversity panel dataset.\n\nTo calculate h^2^, I need trait data for my group of interest (total biomass for genotypes in the switchgrass diversity panel data, at the Austin, Texas site, in 2019) and a kinship matrix. The kinship matrix here contains information about how the switchgrass individuals are genetically related to one another. I've pre-calculated the kinship matrix for these individuals using the Van Raden method [@vanraden2008].\n\nThere are many factors that go in to making the kinship matrix, but I won't go into the details of that here.\n\nFirst, load the R packages I'll need to compute this statistic and load the kinship matrix.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(here)\nlibrary(rrBLUP)\nlibrary(switchgrassGWAS)\n\nk_full <- read_rds(here(\"data\", \"Kinship_van_Raden_630_individuals_SNPs_r2_20percent.rds\"))\n```\n:::\n\n\nThe kinship matrix is a matrix with column and row names that are individual plant IDs (`PLANT_ID` in the trait dataframe).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nstr(k_full)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n num [1:630, 1:630] 1.3406 0.0871 0.0746 0.0404 0.1924 ...\n - attr(*, \"dimnames\")=List of 2\n  ..$ : chr [1:630] \"J181.A\" \"J250.C\" \"J251.C\" \"J352.A\" ...\n  ..$ : chr [1:630] \"J181.A\" \"J250.C\" \"J251.C\" \"J352.A\" ...\n```\n\n\n:::\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nk_full[1:5, 1:5]\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n           J181.A     J250.C     J251.C     J352.A     J001.A\nJ181.A 1.34059943 0.08712208 0.07459743 0.04039814 0.19244956\nJ250.C 0.08712208 1.25057146 0.30333836 0.09003609 0.14031216\nJ251.C 0.07459743 0.30333836 1.26267550 0.05864841 0.16804045\nJ352.A 0.04039814 0.09003609 0.05864841 1.35194085 0.04047479\nJ001.A 0.19244956 0.14031216 0.16804045 0.04047479 1.18593277\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNext, load the trait data. Here I am going to use the publicly available trait data from the [switchgrassGWAS R package](https://alice-macqueen.github.io/switchgrassGWAS/).\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\ntrait_data <- switchgrassGWAS::pvdiv_phenotypes\n```\n:::\n\n\nTo calculate narrow-sense heritability for one trait, `CLMB_BIOMASS`, I need to manipulate the trait dataframe so that the `PLANT_ID` included match the ones in the kinship matrix.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\none_trait <- trait_data |> \n  filter(!is.na(CLMB_BIOMASS)) |>  # <1>\n  filter(PLANT_ID %in% colnames(k_full)) # <2>\n```\n:::\n\n\n1.  Filter individuals to those with data in the CLMB_BIOMASS column\n2.  Filter individuals to those with PLANT_ID that match the names in the kinship matrix.\n\nThen, I need to make sure that the same `PLANT_ID` are present in the kinship matrix and in the dataframe, in the same order. To do this, first I find the numerical values of the column names that are in the trait dataframe, then I subset the kinship matrix to just those values.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nk_in_phe <- which(colnames(k_full) %in% one_trait$PLANT_ID)\nk_one <- k_full[k_in_phe, k_in_phe]\n```\n:::\n\n\nThen, make sure that the PLANT_ID in the trait dataframe are in the same order as those in the kinship matrix by making the PLANT_ID from the kinship matrix into a dataframe, and joining the trait dataframe to it.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nk_order <- enframe(colnames(k_one), name = NULL, value = \"PLANT_ID\")\none_trait <- k_order |> \n  left_join(one_trait, by = \"PLANT_ID\")\n```\n:::\n\n\nFinally, check that all the PLANT_ID in the two dataframes are equal.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nall.equal(k_order, select(one_trait, PLANT_ID))\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] TRUE\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nNow, we used mixed.solve() from the rrBLUP package to calculate both the additive genetic variation (Vu) and the error variation in the trait (Ve). Added together, Vu and Ve make up the total trait variation in the population.\n\n\n::: {.cell}\n\n```{.r .cell-code}\nmod2 <- mixed.solve(y = one_trait$CLMB_BIOMASS, K = k_one)\n\nh2 <- mod2$Vu/(mod2$Vu + mod2$Ve)\n\nround(h2, digits = 4)\n```\n\n::: {.cell-output .cell-output-stdout}\n\n```\n[1] 0.8923\n```\n\n\n:::\n:::\n\n\nh^2^ for the biomass at CLMB is 0.8923. This is a very high heritability, suggesting that additive SNP-trait associations may explain much of the trait variation at this location.\n\n\n\n",
